A Rust Desktop Background Project.

Currently, it creates a window which looks somewhat likes this, except animated. CPU usage is around 0-1% on my machine, which is pretty good. Should run on Windows/Mac/Linux.

### A Roadmap for the future

- Better shaders
- Smooth Transition between shaders
- Autocolors
- Better screen background emulation
  - A la ![desktopgalaxy](https://github.com/khemritolya/desktopgalaxy) would require X11 badness.
